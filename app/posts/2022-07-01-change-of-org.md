title: Change of organisation and trading name
description: Design work on 'Change business name' and 'Change trading name' journeys

We initially enhanced the change of business name journey to allow users who are ETMP mastered/in partnerships to change their business name using the VAT service, rather than having to apply to change it through Companies House. We built the journey based on the existing trading name journey, bearing in mind some of the accessibility feedback we’d received from RADs. Because the trading name hadn’t yet gone live, we then applied those design changes to that journey too, with an additional ‘Add’ journey that we didn’t have in the organisation name path as a user has to have a business name.

There was additional work around blocking obscene words in names upon entry, however that work wasn’t continued due to the complex technical nature of the work in blocking certain instances of an obscene word (pluralised, contained within another word, legitimate use cases of a word e.g. ‘Fresh Cow’s Milk’ is acceptable, despite the fact that ‘cow’ can be used in a derogatory sense), and the subjectivity of what an obscene word is.
