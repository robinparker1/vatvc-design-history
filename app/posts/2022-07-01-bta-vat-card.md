The ask came from the business to redesign VATâ€™s BTA card in preparation of the bulk migration of users to our new world VAT View and Change service. BTA stakeholders wished for us to design something more akin to the cards already on the BTA, however we uncovered that there may be a balance to strike between this and user needs, and users seemed to manage with an extremely simplified card due to the easy to use nature of the new VAT service.

We designed a new card that struck a balance between remaining consistent with other BTA card principles, yet greatly reducing the amount of content that was on the previous card, and highlighting a view to the future for the VAT card which pointed more towards a further simplified version of the card.

Technical issues meant that late in the design cycle we had to remove content informing a user as to how much money they owed HMRC.

There is further work to be done on this for the Penalties team, who in future will be considering how penalties can be surfaced on the card, but this is a more general BTA point.
